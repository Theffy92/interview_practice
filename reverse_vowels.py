The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters. 

Pseudocode

1. create a variable to store all the vowels
2. get the 2 first and last letters in the string. 2 pointers
3. loop through the string 
4. check if the left pointer is a vowel and if the right pointer is a vowel
